# Many-to-Many Relationship Example

This repository explores the concept of **many-to-many relationships** in database design. It demonstrates how to model and implement this relationship effectively using technologies like **Node.js** and **MongoDB**.

## Key Concepts
- **Many-to-Many Relationship**: A type of association where multiple records in one table are related to multiple records in another table.
- **Database Modeling**: Structuring data models to handle associations through linking/bridge tables or collections.
- **Implementation**: Practical examples of querying and managing many-to-many relationships in a real-world application.

## Technologies Used
- **Node.js**: Backend framework for creating APIs and handling database operations.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database used to manage data and create many-to-many relationships.

## Project Features
- Create and manage many-to-many relationships.
- Examples of real-world use cases.
